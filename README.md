# Playing-Cards-

my first Go project where you can create a new deck and perform many actions on that deck such as shuffle, deal and even save your deck into your hardrive as well as receive a previous deck that has been saved before. 

A test file has also been coded to test out an IO method and also the creation of a deck method.
